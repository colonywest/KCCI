# KCCI SchoolNet 8 Desktop Weather Client

If you live within the [KCCI](https://kcci.com) viewing area, this application is definitely for you.

The KCCI SchoolNet 8 Desktop Weather Client allows you to access weather information available on the [KCCI SchoolNet 8 network](https://www.schoolnet8.com). The information is up to the minute and accurate so you know exactly what temperature it is outside at the minute you check it.

Plus you can check the radar and get the current forecast all in the same application. You won't need to open a separate program or visit another web page for your local weather. And since the weather is from KCCI, you know it's weather information you can count on.
